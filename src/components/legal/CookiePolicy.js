                        In addition to what is specified in this document, the User can manage preferences for Cookies directly from within their own browser and prevent – for example – third parties from installing Cookies.<br />
                        Through browser preferences, it is also possible to delete Cookies installed in the past, including the Cookies that may have saved the initial consent for the installation of Cookies by this website.<br />
                        Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
                        <br /><br />
                        With regard to Cookies installed by third parties, Users can manage their preferences and withdrawal of their consent by clicking the related opt-out link (if provided), by using the means provided in the third party&#39;s privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.
                        <br /><br />
                        Notwithstanding the above, the Owner informs that Users may follow the instructions provided on the subsequently linked initiatives by the Your Online Choices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.
                        Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.
                        The Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.
